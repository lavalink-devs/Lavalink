!!! warning

    Lavalink previously set the `-Xmx` flag to `4G` in docker. This caused issues with some systems which had less than 4GB of RAM. We have now removed this flag and let the JVM decide the max heap allocation.
    On how to increase the max heap allocation, see [here](https://lavalink.dev/configuration/docker.html#docker).
