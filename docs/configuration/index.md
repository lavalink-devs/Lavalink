# Configuration

There are mainly 3 different ways to configure Lavalink:

## Config File

This is the easiest way to configure Lavalink. You create a file called `application.yml` where you start your Lavalink server.
See the [application.yml](config/application-yml.md) documentation for more information.

## Environment Variables

You can also configure Lavalink using environment variables.
See the [environment variables](config/environment-variables.md) documentation for more information.

## Config Server

> **WARNING:** This is an advanced feature geared towards big deployments.

You can run the [Lavalink Config Server](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink-Config-Server) to manage the configuration of multiple Lavalink servers at one place.
See the [Config Server](config/config-server.md) documentation for more information.
